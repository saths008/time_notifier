# time_notifier

## Setup

This only works for Linux.

- Make sure 'paplay' is installed for playing sounds.
- Make sure 'notify_send' is installed for sending notifs.
- Make sure clang/g++ is installed to support c++20.
- Make sure perl is installed [Install perl](https://learn.perl.org/installing/unix_linux.html)

Then all you have to do is run the interactive setup script:

```bash
perl set_up.pl
```
